    <div class="quintet_history">
        <p>The Celebration Brass Quintet was founded in 2001 by members of the Minnetonka Symphony Orchestra and began its career as artists-in-residence at Gethsemane Lutheran Church in Hopkins.
            Drawing from a library of more than 700 arrangements, the quintet has developed a wide repertoire in a variety of musical genres, including jazz, Dixieland, ragtime, classical, show tunes,
            and "golden oldies." The Celebration Brass has played at numerous venues across the Twin Cities area, including Music Association of Minnetonka concerts, weddings, churches, arts centers,

            <h3>Peter Weissmann, trumpet</h3>
            <p>Peter was introduced to music by his father, an auto mechanic from Austria, who listened to the music of the great Viennese composers while working on the family car on weekends.
                Peter's first musical memory from childhood is the third movement of Haydn's Trumpet Concerto, so it was perhaps foreordained that he began to study the trumpet at age 10. Since then
                he has played and studied with some of the top musicians in the Twin Cities. His musical background is broad with experience in orchestras, large wind ensembles, chamber music, jazz
                big bands, and more. He has performed regularly at churches and other venues as a soloist and in ensembles. In his spare time, Peter is Professor of Medicine at the University of
                Minnesota.</p>

                University of Minnesota where he graduated with a degree in Music Education. He is a member of the Minnetonka Symphony Orchestra and Minnetonka Concert Band, and has served on the
